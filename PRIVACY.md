# Privacy Policy - TOS Analyzer

**Last Updated: December 2024**

## Our Commitment to Privacy

TOS Analyzer is built with privacy as a core principle. We believe your data should remain yours, and that's why our extension is designed to process everything locally on your device.

## Data Processing

### What We Analyze
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy content found on websites you visit
- Text content from modals, popups, and embedded legal documents
- Website URLs where terms are detected (stored locally only)

### How We Process Data
- **All analysis is performed locally** on your device using local AI models
- **No data is ever transmitted** to external servers or third parties
- **No cloud processing** - everything happens in your browser
- **No user tracking** or analytics collection

## Data Storage

### What We Store Locally
- Your extension settings and preferences
- Analysis results for websites you've visited (cached for performance)
- Risk assessments and recommendations generated locally

### Storage Location
- All data is stored in your browser's local storage
- Data never leaves your device
- You can export, import, or delete all data at any time through extension settings

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Browsing history beyond TOS detection
- ❌ User identifiers or device fingerprints
- ❌ Analytics or usage statistics
- ❌ Crash reports or telemetry
- ❌ Any data for advertising purposes

## Permissions

Our extension requests minimal permissions:

### Required Permissions
- **`activeTab`**: To scan the current page for Terms of Service
- **`storage`**: To save your settings and analysis results locally
- **`scripting`**: To inject content scripts for TOS detection

### What These Permissions Allow
- Reading webpage content to detect TOS/Privacy Policy text
- Storing analysis results and settings in your browser
- Displaying analysis results and notifications

### What These Permissions DO NOT Allow
- Accessing your browsing history
- Reading content from other tabs
- Transmitting data to external servers
- Tracking your activity across websites

## AI Processing

### Local AI Models
- We use lightweight AI models that run entirely in your browser
- Models are downloaded once and cached locally
- No AI processing occurs on external servers
- Your TOS content never leaves your device during analysis

### Model Updates
- Model updates are distributed as part of extension updates
- Updated models replace the old ones locally
- No user data is involved in model update processes

## Third-Party Services

### What We Don't Use
- ❌ External analytics services
- ❌ Crash reporting services
- ❌ Cloud-based AI APIs
- ❌ Advertising networks
- ❌ User tracking services

### Optional Donation Links
- The extension includes optional donation links (Buy Me a Coffee)
- Clicking these links opens external websites
- We do not track or monitor donation interactions
- Donation prompts can be permanently dismissed

## Data Security

### Local Security
- Data is protected by your browser's security model
- We follow Chrome extension security best practices

### Data Requests

- All your data is already under your control locally

## Verification

### How to Verify Our Claims
1. **Check Network Activity**: Use browser dev tools to verify no external requests
2. **Review Source Code**: All code is available on GitHub
3. **Monitor Storage**: Check what's stored in your browser's extension storage
4. **Offline Testing**: Extension works without internet connection

## Summary

**TOS Analyzer is designed with privacy by default:**
- ✅ All processing happens locally on your device
- ✅ No data collection or transmission
- ✅ You control all your data
- ✅ Open source and transparent
